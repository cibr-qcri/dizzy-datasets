Public datasets from [Dizzy](https://dizzy-dev.cibr.qcri.org) â€“ a darkweb analytical search engine.

The following datasets are from our 10-month Dizzy deployment in 2021/2022. We're working with our IRB to decide which parts of the complete dataset are _fine_ to share, given that some domains host illicit content. As of now, we'll be releasing one or more smaller datasets with useful annotations.

In order to preserve the privacy of domain operators, we only share the MD5 hash of the domain name (including .onion) in hexademical format. For example, the hash of Facebook's v3 onion domain in Python is:

```python
>>> import hashlib
>>> hashlib.md5(b"facebookwkhpilnemxj7asaniu7vnjjbiltxjqhye3mhbshg7kx5tfyd.onion").hexdigest()
'5a59274ccdd9a8c5cbe969e971e92aa5'
```

This way you'll be able to know if you have the same domain names by comparing their MD5 hashes. This is the methodology used by [Ahmia](https://ahmia.fi/blacklist/) to share blacklisted onion domains.

## [domains-basic.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cibr-qcri/dizzy-datasets/main/domains-basic.json)

This dataset contains basic information of 32,555 unique onion domains from our crawl. Each line in the dataset file is a JSON dump of a key/value object describing a domain, as follows:

| Key        | Value                                                                                         |
|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| domain     | MD5 hexadecimal hash of the onion domain with `.onion` TLD                                    |
| is_v3      | True is the domain is hosted by a v3 onion service                                            |
| category   | Domain category: "socialmedia", "marketplace", "pornography", "crypto", "indexer", or "other" |
| is_illicit | True if domain hosts illict or illegal content (e.g., CSAM, drugs)                            |
